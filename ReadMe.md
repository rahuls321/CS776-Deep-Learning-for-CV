Following are the package dependencies with their versions and I have also created one requirements.txt
So do `pip install -r requirements.txt` will install all packages.

This folder contains following directories and files 
1. **cifar-10-batches-py** - contains all the data used in this assignment 1
2. **output** - contains all the output generated by the code including all the plots
    a. Augmented - contains all the plots when model was running on augmented datasets.
    a. Unaugmented - contains all the plots when model was running on unaugmented datasets.
3. **main.py** - The main file for this assignment contains all the code associated with assignment
4. **mlp.py** - It contains the MLP model class with backproagation and other associated functions.
5. **feature_extractor.py** - generate feature vector of an image using ResNet model
6. **run.sh** - script file to run the complete assignment
7. **log.txt** - contains all logs of the output trained on different sets of hyperparameters
8. **requirements.txt** - contains the package dependencies

`run.sh` is the top-level script that runs the entire assignment.

To run the entire assignment, go to home directory where this README file is there and use --> ./run.sh 

# ./run.sh -- this will generate all the results in the output folder. 
# Incase you face any issue in running the code, just let me know here - rahulkumar21@iitk.ac.in or whatsapp @ 7761937143
